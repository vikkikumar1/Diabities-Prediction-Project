#OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:-

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and applying various machine learning models to make accurate predictions. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.
